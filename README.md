WiFi-connected desk companion using a Raspberry Pi Pico W & Circuit Python by Abby Bergman

Instructable for build COMING SOON

Make sure your Raspberry Pi Pico W has the latest version of CircuitPython. The "lib" folder on your Pico should have the following folders/files: 
    - adafruit_display_text
    - adafruit_ntp.mpy
    - adafruit_st7735r.mpy
    - circuitpython_schedule.mpy

This was created for a final project submission for the Physical Computing course taught by Prof. John Gallaugher at Boston College.
